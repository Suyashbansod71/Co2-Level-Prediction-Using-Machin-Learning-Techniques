# Forecasting-Co2-Levels-Perosnal-Project-
This Repository contains work done by me in predicting the Co2 Levels using Machine Learning.
The dataset which I have used contains weekly averages of Co2 levels from air samples which were collected from March 1958 to December 2001.
In this project I have aimed to produce reliable Forecasts of Time Series.
I have used ARIMA Model using Python for Time Series Forecasting Of Future Co2 Levels.
ARIMA stands for  AutoregRessive Integrated Moving Average.
ARIMA is a model that can be fitted to time series data in order to better understand or predict future points in the series.
